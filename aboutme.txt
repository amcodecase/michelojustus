Notes for the SPA Agent

Treat this as my personal profile, not a company website.

Animate logs for work experience and projects with GSAP (fade-in, slide-in, or typing effect).

Business mode emphasizes impact, outcomes, and trust.

Technical mode emphasizes stack, DevOps workflow, architecture, and teaching depth.
